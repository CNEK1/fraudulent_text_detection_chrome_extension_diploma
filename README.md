# Fraudulent Text Detection Chrome Extension

The Fraudulent Text Detection Chrome Extension is a powerful tool designed to help users identify and avoid falling victim to fraudulent messages. By integrating with a Django server, this extension provides real-time analysis of highlighted text on any webpage, determining the likelihood of it being part of a scam or phishing attempt.

## Getting Started

To use this extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Add the extension to your Google Chrome browser.
3. Navigate to any webpage and highlight the text you want to analyze.
4. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
5. The extension will send the highlighted text to the Django server for analysis.
6. A response will be displayed indicating whether the message seems to be fraudulent.

## Features

- **Secure**: Ensures that your data is transmitted securely to the server for analysis.

## How It Works

The extension captures the selected text on your browser and sends it to a Django server, where it is processed using advanced machine learning algorithms. The server then returns a prediction that classifies the text as potentially fraudulent or legitimate.

## Usage

To use the extension, simply highlight any suspicious text you encounter while browsing. Then, click the extension icon to send the text for analysis. The result will be displayed promptly, helping you to make informed decisions about the trustworthiness of the content.
